The data-set has been used to learn different ML and NN models and classifiers.<br>

For better understanding of machine learning concepts I used this data-set to implement different machine learning models.<br>

The implementation is as follows:<br>
1. Logistic Regression - accuracy = 89.67%<br>
2. Neural Network with L2 Regularization - test set accuracy = 10.0<br>
3. Neural Network with Dropout Regularization - accuracy = 86.0%<br>
4. Neural Network with Multi Layers = 92.1%<br>

After implementing the above four models the conclusion says that with this data-set the maximum accuracy we are getting on our test set is from “Multi-Layer Neural Network”.
